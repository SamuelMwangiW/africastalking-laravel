# SIM Swap

The API operates by providing an additional layer of security for transactions and sensitive operations. When a service detects a request that requires authentication, such as a bank transaction or account login, the API can check the status of the userâ€™s SIM card. It looks for red flags, such as a recent SIM Swap, that could indicate a potential fraud attempt. If suspicious activity is detected, the transaction can be halted, and additional verification steps can be initiated.


```php
// Simple Example
$result = Africastalking::insights()
        ->for('+254722000000')
        ->send();
```

```php
// Alternative
$result = Africastalking::simSwap()
        ->for('+254722000000')
        ->send();
```

```php
// With Multiple numbers
$result = Africastalking::insights()
        ->for('+254711000000')
        ->add('+254722000000')
        ->add('+256786000000')
        ->send();
```

```php
// With Idempotency Key
$result = Africastalking::insights()
        ->for('+254722000000')
        ->idempotent('b457c437-72cd-46b1-b450-d3a12c400810')
        ->send();
```
